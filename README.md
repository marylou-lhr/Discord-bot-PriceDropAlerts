#About my bot
##Shows the user the name and initial prices of the products my bot is monitoring
This feature is a slash command and is working
##Sends an alert each time a product is in sale
Not sure if it works yet. I'll update this README when I'll know.

###Please note :
It's my first time making a bot and using git outside of my git introduction class, so I apologize for my number of "useless" commits.
This bot is for personal use only, but I might make it public if I can give it useful features (and if its main feature works).
